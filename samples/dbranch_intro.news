The idea is to break up the news into several branches. By decoupling each branch’s financial incentives, we can minimize pernicious aspects of the legacy media’s business model.\nAs legacy media has been losing its trust and viewership, independent media has stepped up. It’s matured over the years but lacks an economic model with investigative researchers and field crews on the ground, sourcing information. Bits and pieces of these exist in the new media space, but it is too fragmented to realize its full potential. Centralization can fix the fragmentation but is self-defeating. Instead, dBranch will standardize it, enabling it to scale without centralization. The dBranch protocol will add cohesion to independent media and replace legacy media as the network effect kicks in.\nThe Branches"},{"attributes":{"header":2},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"Audience"},{"attributes":{"list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"Contributors"},{"attributes":{"list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"Investigative Research"},{"attributes":{"list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"Review (academic & creative)"},{"attributes":{"list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"Studios, office & field crew"},{"attributes":{"list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"Curators"},{"attributes":{"list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"The dBranch DAO will maintain open source software and the protocol.

Low dollar subscribers are only able to support a small number of independent journalists each working to separate ends. dBranch will solve this problem by enabling the crowd to fund an entire ecosystem including investigative reporters, studios and field crews and curators who aggregate publications.\nContributors will be able to raise money like in any crowd funded application, but in dBranch the audience will also be able to create bounties to incentivize contributors to work on a specific topic.

It could be as simple as pooling donations for a small group of otherwise independent journalists, or as complex as funding an entire ecosystem, ensuring a portion of the funds go to one or more organizations in each branch.\nContributor branch"},{"attributes":{"header":2},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"Journalists, commentators, analysts, etc. will all publish work as contributors, and by decorrelating their income from clicks, they can write how they want rather than how the algorithms want.
